# Commit check

A quick wrapper around git that formats the commits in a conventional style.

The benefit to using this over other tooling such as commitzen is that this
can be compiled down to a binary and doesn't therefore require node or python
on the machine.
It also doesn't require others on the team to use the standardised format,
although you will get more out of other tooling in the space if everyone does
use the same commit structure.
